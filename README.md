## Features

### Ender Chest Command

This mod adds a new command to open the player's ender chest. Players can use either of the following commands to access their ender chest:

- `/ec`
- `/enderchest`

To successfully open the ender chest, players must have an ender chest in their inventory. If the player doesn't have an ender chest, the command will not function.

### Drying Wet Sponges

With RemusNetworkUtilities, wet sponges placed on top of magma blocks will gradually dry, similar to their behavior in the Nether. This feature adds a touch of realism and convenience to your gameplay, allowing you to efficiently reuse wet sponges.

### Failed Login Logging with fail2ban Integration

RemusNetworkUtilities incorporates a fail2ban-like functionality to log failed login attempts on your Minecraft server. This feature helps track and identify abusive login attempts. The mod logs these failed logins, which can then be used in conjunction with fail2ban to automatically ban malicious IPs. Make sure to set up fail2ban with appropriate rules to utilize this feature effectively.
